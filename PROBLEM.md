## Problem: Determining the Enthalpy of Formation of Acetylene (C₂H₂)

You are provided with the following standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔcH°) values at 298 K:

1.  C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)      ΔcH° = -393.5 kJ/mol
2.  H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) → H₂O(l)    ΔcH° = -285.8 kJ/mol
3.  C₂H₂(g) + ⁵⁄₂O₂(g) → 2CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)  ΔcH° = -1300.0 kJ/mol

Using the information above, address the following parts in your solution file:

**Part A: Calculation**
Using Hess's Law, calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔfH°) for acetylene, C₂H₂(g), from its elements in their standard states:
C(s) + H₂(g) → C₂H₂(g)   ΔfH° = ?

**Part B: Energy Profile**
Draw a simple ASCII or text-based energy profile diagram for the reaction in Part A. Clearly label the reactants, products, activation energy (Ea), and the enthalpy change (ΔH).

**Part C: Experimental Design**
Describe the experimental procedure you would use to verify the enthalpy of combustion of acetylene (Reaction 3) using a bomb calorimeter. In your description, explain the purpose of at least three key components of the apparatus (e.g., the bomb vessel, the water bath, the thermometer).
